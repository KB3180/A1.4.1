## Procedural Abstraction

A lot of practical, reusable, published code is object-oriented code. The API of an object-oriented library defines the attributes and methods for each class. Attributes are data, and methods are procedures. Procedures, since they are instructions coded in language, are just a special kind of data!

The method’s instructions are stored once, when the class is defined. The instructions can be used over and over for the entire class of objects. “Calling a method on an object” tells the computer to execute the class’ instructions (the method) for that kind of object (class), using the attribute data that is specific to that particular object (instance).

What are some procedures you perform for various instances of a category? For example you have a procedure for crossing a street, and it can be executed at any given street of a particular kind. What is a procedure that you follow that can be applied as you follow your daily routines? How are those routines applied to slightly different situations?
